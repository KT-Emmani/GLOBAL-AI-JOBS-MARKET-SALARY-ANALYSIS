## Data Cleaning & Preparation

- ### SQL
   - Launched Microsoft SSMS database, connected to the SQL Server.
   - Created a database to import the data as a table for the analysis.
   - Used the Window function to calculate the Average Salary over Job_Title, Experience_level, Employment_Type, Company_Location. This was done to know the average salary of a specific job title using the PARTITION BY Clause. The average salary is then repeated for all rows in the respective job title, experience level, employment type and company's location.
   - Used the CASE clause to rename some coloumns
