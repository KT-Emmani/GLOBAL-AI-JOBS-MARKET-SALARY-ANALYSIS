## Overview 
This project aims to conduct comprehensive analysis and visualizes AI jobs market trends and salary globally from January 2024 to March 2025. It focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total Job posting, total annual salary, avaerage salary, number of AI jobs, avaerage job posting duration with detailed breakdowns by monthly postings, experience level, company size, job positions, remote types, year of experience, skills, country, industry, company, educational level, employment type, benefit score and employee residence (employers target market). The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders understand the factors that influence AI jobs salaries, job patterns based on country, industry and company.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

- ### SQL
   - Launched Microsoft SSMS database, connected to the SQL Server.
   - Created a database to import the data as a table for the analysis.
   - Used the Window function to calculate the Average Salary over Job_Title, Experience_level, Employment_Type, Company_Location. This was done to know the average salary of a specific job title using the PARTITION BY Clause. The average salary is then repeated for all rows in the respective job title, experience level, employment type and company's location.
   - Used the CASE Statement to replace data in some fields when it meet a certain conditions. These fields are experience_level, employment_type, remote_ratio and company_size. Also, to group the benefit_score.
   - Used CTE to create a temporary table for complex queries and referencing.
   - Created a Table View for my final data for the analysis and visualization.

```

- ### Power Bi
   - Connected to the SQL Server to import the final data into Power Bi.
   - Created a date table for the time series analysis on the dataset.
   - Used DAX to calculate some measures such as Total Job Postings, Total Annual Salary, Average Salary, Average posting duration.
   - Created a wireframe background using Power Point and uploaded to Power Bi for 
   - Built an interactive dashboard where you can navigate other pages such as Overview, Country, Industry and Company for insights.

 - ### Challenges & Solutions
Analysing the required_skills field was a challenge since all skills required for a unique job posting was grouped together. I resolved it by spliting the required_skills, duplicated the table in Power Query and deleted the other columns excluding the job_id and the skills columns. I then unpivoted all the 5 skills columns against their unique job_id. Then later linked the job_id in skills table to the fact table in the model view.
